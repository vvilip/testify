# Testify

*A lightweight unit testing framework for Java â€” because sometimes, reinventing the wheel is practice.*

---

**Testify** is a simple and minimal unit testing framework written in Java. It was built purely for learning and experimentation, and mimics the core behavior of JUnit â€” just with fewer features and less polish.

## âœ¨ Why use Testify?

You probably shouldn't.

Testify offers no real benefit over existing, battle-tested libraries like [JUnit](https://junit.org). It's less sophisticated, less flexible, and definitely not production-ready.

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress

This project is still under development and is not yet feature-complete. Expect missing features, bugs, and plenty of rough edges.

Feel free to explore the code, give feedback, or fork it to build your own minimal testing tool.
